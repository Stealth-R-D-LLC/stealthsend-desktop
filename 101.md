## Useful explanations and common terms

* mnemonic (phrase) or seed recovery phrase -  a list of words which store all the information needed to recover Bitcoin funds on-chain. Wallet software will typically generate a seed phrase and instruct the user to write it down on paper. If the user's computer breaks or their hard drive becomes corrupted, they can download the same wallet software again and use the paper backup to get their bitcoins back

* seed - A seed in the cryptocurrency world is like a username-password combination to access your funds within a cryptocurrency wallet. Each seed is unique and extremely difficult to guess. These seeds are used to generate the keys used to sign transactions and generate the public address where the funds are stored.

* hd wallet - hierarchical determinstic wallets (or "HD Wallets"): wallets which can be shared partially or entirely with different systems, each with or without the ability to spend coins

* address - your wallet address. a source and/or destination for receiving/sending assets

* randomness - itchy topic. https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/test/integration/addresses.spec.ts

* bip - Bitcoin Improvement Proposal

* bip32 - hd wallets 

* bip39 - implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence -- a group of easy to remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets
