            Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
            so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the

            pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
            in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
            and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data
            subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
            specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the

            e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is
            accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie

            According to Google Inc., under no circumstances will the IP address
            be associated with any other user-related data. More information
